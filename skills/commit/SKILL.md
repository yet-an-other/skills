# Git Commit Skill

Create well-formatted git commits following conventional commit standards.

## Usage
```
/commit
```

## Behavior
1. Analyze staged changes with `git diff --staged`
2. Generate a conventional commit message
3. Create the commit with proper formatting

## Notes
- Use the appropriate type and scope for each commit.
- Keep descriptions concise and informative, use /unslop skill to refine commit messages.
- If the volume of changes is large, break them into multiple commits for clarity. Each commit should focus on a single logical change.
- Avoid committing generated files or dependencies unless necessary.

## Commit Format
```
<type>(<scope>): <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

## Types
- feat: New feature
- fix: Bug fix
- docs: Documentation changes
- style: Code style changes
- refactor: Code refactoring
- test: Adding or modifying tests
- chore: Maintenance tasks

## Example Output
